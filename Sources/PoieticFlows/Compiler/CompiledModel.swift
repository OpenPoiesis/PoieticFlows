/// Core structure used by the simulator and the solver to perform the
/// computation.
///
/// Compiled model is an internal representation of the model design for
/// computation. The structure is guaranteed to provide computational
/// information with integrity, such as order of computation or value types.
///
/// If the model design violates constraints or contains user errors, the
/// compiler refuses to create the compiled model.
///
/// The main content of the compiled model is a list of computed objects
/// ``simulationObjects`` and a list of simulation state variables
/// ``stateVariables``. The computation of computed objects can be carried out
/// in the order provided without causing broken computational dependencies.
///
/// Additional information about specific object types is provided in stored
/// properties such as ``stocks``, ``flows``, ``auxiliaries`` or ``charts``.
///
/// ## Uses by Applications
///
/// Applications running simulations can use the compiled model to fetch various
/// information that is to be presented to the user or that can be expected
/// from the user as an input or as a configuration. For example:
///
/// - ``charts`` to get a list of charts that are specified in the design
///   that the designer considers relevant to be displayed to the user.
/// - ``valueBindings`` to get a list of controls and their targets to generate
///   user interface for changing initial values of model-specific objects.
/// - ``stateVariables`` and their stored property ``StateVariable/name`` to
///   get a list of variables that can be observed.
/// - ``variable(named:)`` to fetch detailed information about a specific
///   variable.
/// - ``timeVariableIndex`` to get an index into ``stateVariables`` where the
///   time variable is stored.
/// - ``simulationDefaults`` for simulation run configuration.
///
/// - Note: The compiled model can also be used in a similar way as
///  "explain plan" in SQL. It contains some information how the simulation
///   will be carried out.
///
/// - SeeAlso: ``Compiler/compile()``, ``Solver/init(_:)``,
///   ``Simulator/init(model:solverType:)``
