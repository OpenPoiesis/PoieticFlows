# Stock and Flow Metamodel

Description of the Stock and Flow domain.

## Overview

The Stock and Flow model domain (metamodel) recognises the following node
types that define the computation:


| Type | Represents | Use | 
|-----|-------------|-----|
| `Stock` | An amount (of a material) in a container, reservoir, or a pool. | computation | 
| `Flow` | Rate by which connected container is filled or drained. | computation |
| `Auxiliary` | Auxiliary computation or a constant | computation | 
| `GraphicalFunction` | Function defined by a set of points | computation |
| `Delay` | Delay of a value by a specific number of time units | computation |
| `Chart` | Visual output in a form of a chart with one or multiple series | visualisation |
| `Control` | Visual input node | experimentation |
| `Note` | User comment | none |

The edges in the domain are:


| Type | Represents | Origin | Target |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `Drains` | What a flow drains | Stock | Flow |
| `Fills` | What a flow fills | Flow | Stock |
| `Parameter` | Connection between an auxiliary and other computation node | any computed | any computed |
| `ChartSeries` | Series of a chart | Chart | any computed |

The constraints that need to be satisfied:

| Constraint | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| `flow_fill_is_stock` | Flow must drain (from) a stock, no other kind of node |
| `flow_drain_is_stock` | Flow must fill (into) a stock, no other kind of node |
| `one_parameter_for_graphical_function` | Graphical function must not have more than one incoming parameters |
| `control_value_binding` | Control binding's origin must be a Control and target must be a formula node | 
| `chart_series` | Chart series edge must originate in Chart and end in Value node |


## Example Model

The following example shows how to create a simple bank account model. First we
create the nodes:

```swift
let design = Design(metamodel: Metamodel.StockFlow)
let frame = design.createFrame()

let account = frame.createNode(ObjectType.Stock,
                               name: "account",
                               attributes: ["formula": "100"])

let rate = frame.createNode(ObjectType.Auxiliary,
                            name: "rate",
                            attributes: ["formula": "0.02"])

let interest = frame.createNode(ObjectType.Auxiliary,
                                name: "interest",
                                attributes: ["formula": "account * rate"])

```

The nodes need to be connected:

```swift
frame.createEdge(ObjectType.Parameter, origin: rate, target: interest)
frame.createEdge(ObjectType.Parameter, origin: account, target: interest)
frame.createEdge(ObjectType.Fills, origin: interest, target: account)
```

- Note: Typically you would not be creating detailed models by hand like in the
  above example. The purpose of the library is to provide functionality for
  applications that aid in model design.

## Attributes

### Stock

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `formula` | string | Initial stock value |
| `allows_negative` | bool | Flag whether the stock can contain a negative value |
| `delayed_inflow` | bool | Flag whether the inflow of the stock is delayed by one step, when the stock is part of a cycle |

### Flow

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `formula` | string | Flow rate computation |
| `priority` | int | Priority during computation. The flows are considered in the ascending order of priority |

### Auxiliary

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `formula` | string | Constant or an auxiliary computation formula |

### Graphical Function

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `interpolation_method` | string | Method of interpolation for values between the points |
| `graphical_function_points` | array of points | Points of the graphical function |

The only interpolation method that is currently available is `step`.


Example:
```swift
let points: [Points] = [ /* list of Points */ ]
let yield = frame.createNode(ObjectType.Auxiliary,
                                name: "yield",
                                attributes: [
                                    "graphical_function_points": points
                                ])
```

### Delay

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `delay_duration` | double | Delay duration in time units. |
| `delay_output_type` | string | Type of delay output computation |

The only available type of delay output computation is `delay1`.


### Chart

Currently no attributes for charts.

### Control

Control is a node that can be used by graphical applications to provide
user-interface for controlling values of other nodes.

Controls types are not currently specified.

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `value` | double | Value of the target node |
| `control_type` | string | Visual type of the control |
| `min_value` | double | Minimum allowed value of the target variable |
| `max_value` | double | Maximum allowed value of the target variable |
| `step_value` | double | Step of a slider control |
| `value_format` | double | Display format of the value |



### Simulation

Simulation node specifies characteristics of a simulation. There should be only
one node of this type in the design. If multiple Simulation nodes are present,
then one is chosen arbitrarily.

Simulation node is not required to be present, but might be in the future.

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `steps` | int | Number of steps the simulation is run (if not specified otherwise) |
| `initial_time` | double | Initial simulation time |
| `time_delta` | double | Simulation step time delta |
