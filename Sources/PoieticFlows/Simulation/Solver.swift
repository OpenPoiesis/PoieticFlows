/// An abstract class for equations solvers.
///
/// Purpose of a solver is to initialise values of the nodes and then
/// to compute and integrate each step of the simulation.
///
/// Solver is using a ``CompiledModel``, which is guaranteed to be correct
/// for computation.
///
/// The main method of the solver is ``compute(_:at:timeDelta:)``, which is
/// provided by concrete subclasses of the solver.
///
/// To use the solver, it needs to be initialised first, then the
/// ``compute(_:at:timeDelta:)`` is called for each step of the simulation.
///
/// ```swift
/// // Assume we have a compiled model.
/// let compiled: CompiledModel
///
/// let solver = EulerSolver(compiled)
///
/// var time: Double = 0.0
/// let timeDelta: Double = 1.0
///
/// var state: StateVector = solver.initializeState(time: time,
///                                                 timeDelta: timeDelta)
///
/// for step in (1...100) {
///     time += timeDelta
///     state = try solver.compute(state,
///                                at: time,
///                                timeDelta: timeDelta)
///     print(state)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// To get a solver by name:
///
/// ```swift
/// // Assume this is given, provided by the user or in a configuration.
/// let solverTypeName: String
/// guard let solverType = Solver.registeredSolvers[solverTypeName] else {

/// let solver = solverType.init()
